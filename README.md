# Hogwarts Wizardry Program Management System

## Project Overview

A comprehensive **Information System Design** project for managing the **Wizardry Program at Hogwarts School**. This system handles the complete student application and acceptance process, from initial application submission through final admission decisions, including interviews, waiting lists, and conditional acceptances.

## üéØ System Purpose

The system manages the complex admission process for Hogwarts School's Wizardry Program, handling multiple decision paths and time-sensitive processes while accommodating various stakeholders including applicants, acceptance committees, and the program chair.

## üìã Core Functionality

### Application Process Management
- **Initial Application Submission**: Handle incoming student applications
- **Multi-Stage Decision Process**: Support various response types (acceptance, rejection, interview, waiting list)
- **Interview Scheduling**: Coordinate interviews with acceptance committee
- **Conditional Acceptance Tracking**: Monitor and evaluate conditional requirements
- **Waiting List Management**: Time-bound waiting periods with automatic processing

### Administrative Features
- **Program Chair Activities**: Support for different operational periods
- **Committee Management**: Handle acceptance committee operations
- **Periodic Reporting**: Generate acceptance reports and statistics
- **Strike Management**: Handle academic staff strikes and process suspension

## üîÑ Application Workflow

### Initial Response Types
1. **‚úÖ Accepted**: Direct admission to the program
2. **‚ùå Rejected**: Final rejection (cannot reapply)  
3. **üìã Interview Invitation**: Schedule with acceptance committee
4. **‚è≥ Waiting List**: 3-week maximum waiting period

### Post-Interview Outcomes
- **Acceptance**: Full admission to program
- **Conditional Acceptance**: Admission with specific requirements
- **Rejection**: Final rejection decision
- **Waiting List**: Additional waiting period (max 3 weeks)

### Special Processes
- **Conditional Evaluation**: End-of-semester requirement checking
- **Time-Based Decisions**: Automatic rejection after 3-week waiting periods
- **Strike Handling**: Process suspension and resumption capabilities

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture
## üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools & Technologies
- **Visual Paradigm**: UML model creation (recommended CASE tool)
- **Microsoft Access**: Database implementation and QBE queries
- **Microsoft Office**: Documentation (Word, Excel)
